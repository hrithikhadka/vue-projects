# Vue JS

Vue is a framework used for creating user interfaces, and it is pronounced /vjuÀê/, like the word "view." This framework has been designed to be progressively adoptable, which means that it can be easily scaled to meet different use cases. It can be used as a library or a framework, depending on your needs. The core library of Vue focuses on the view layer of your application, while the supporting libraries in its ecosystem help you manage complexity in larger Single-Page Applications. Vue is user-friendly and can be used for a wide range of applications. <br/>
